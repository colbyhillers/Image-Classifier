# Image Classifier Practice

Using the "Hello World" equivalent image set for image classification, I trained a model utilizing the [Softmax Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) 
and the Negative Log-Likelihood Function. The purpose of this exercise was to become more familiar with basic PyTorch usage and implementation. Although this is simple I
plan to expand this into a more applicable project later down the road.
